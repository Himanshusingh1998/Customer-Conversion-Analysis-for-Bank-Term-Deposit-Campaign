1. Goal of the Project

The goal of the project was to identify the target customers most likely to subscribe to a term deposit and determine the key factors influencing customer conversion during a telemarketing campaign.
The objective was to help the bank improve future marketing strategies and customer targeting efficiency.

2. What the Analysis Does

Data Cleaning & Preparation:

Removed duplicate and incomplete records.

Converted categorical “yes/no” values to binary format (1/0).

Standardized date, time, and text formats.

Removed outliers to improve data accuracy.

Univariate & Bivariate Analysis:

Explored key customer attributes — age, job type, education, marital status, and loans.

Studied call-related factors such as duration, day, and month of contact.

Compared subscription outcomes against key variables (education, marital status, previous contact, campaign month, and past outcome).

3. Output Generated

A cleaned, structured dataset suitable for predictive modeling or business intelligence reporting.
